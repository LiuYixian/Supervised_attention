-LRB- CNN -RRB- The only thing crazier than a guy in snowbound Massachusetts boxing up the powdery white stuff and offering it for sale online ? <S_SEP> People are actually buying it . <S_SEP> For $ 89 , self-styled entrepreneur Kyle Waring will ship you 6 pounds of Boston-area snow in an insulated Styrofoam box -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs , he says . <S_SEP> But not if you live in New England or surrounding states . <S_SEP> `` We will not ship snow to any states in the northeast ! '' says Waring 's website , ShipSnowYo.com . `` We 're in the business of expunging snow ! '' <S_SEP> His website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on Tuesday alone , his busiest day yet . <S_SEP> With more than 45 total inches , Boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history . Most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance , but Waring saw an opportunity . <S_SEP> According to Boston.com , it all started a few weeks ago , when Waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in Manchester-by-the-Sea , a coastal suburb north of Boston . He joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states , and an idea was born . <S_SEP> His business slogan : `` Our nightmare is your dream ! '' <S_SEP> At first , ShipSnowYo sold snow packed into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $ 19.99 , but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination . <S_SEP> So this week , Waring began shipping larger amounts in the Styrofoam cubes , which he promises will arrive anywhere in the U.S. in less than 20 hours . <S_SEP> He also has begun selling a 10-pound box of snow for $ 119 . <S_SEP> Many of his customers appear to be companies in warm-weather states who are buying the snow as a gag , he said . <S_SEP> Whether Waring can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen . But he has no shortage of product . <S_SEP> `` At this rate , it 's going to be July until the snow melts , '' he told Boston.com . `` But I 've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items . Maybe I 'll ship some fall foliage . ''
